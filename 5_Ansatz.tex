\chapter{Analysis rules}

\section{Preliminaries}\label{approach}

Before talking about the inference rules, some preliminary notations need to be established. First, the notion of a \textit{callsite} seems at its first glance trivial but becomes more complex when considering references that may contain callsites or again references to other callsite-containing tables. Second, the effect of shadowing must be formally captured. Third, some simplifying notations and placeholders are introduced to shorten the already lenghtly rules.

%\subsection{No VOLATILE functions}
%Without referential transparancy we cannot assume that two function calls within the same query return the same value, making it impossible to use memoization. Therefore, only UDFs markes as STABLE or IMMUTEABLE (38.7. Function Volatility Categories) are translateable.
%Since we use \texttt{UNION} during the evaluation-phase, the rows are checked on equality. This confronts us with a quirk of PostgreSQL: Composite types have no built in function to check equality, thus \texttt{UNION} fails while checking if two composite-types are equal. Later on we will lift this constraint by casting the nonhashable types to and from text.

%Normal UNION require sortable or hashable, but in WITH RECURSIVE it is always hashable, see\footnote{https://www.postgresql-archive.org/Hashable-custom-types-td5801576.html, https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/xindex.html#XINDEX-OPCLASS-DEPENDENCIES, }

\subsection{Notation}
We say a subtree in the query-block of an UDF named $fn$ has or contains a callsite, if and only if the tree contains a node with a call to the function itself or contains a reference to a table that has a callsite. This table in turn does not need to contain an explicit recursive call but can also contain a reference to a table that is recursive by this definition. This comes from the property that table-references are transitive.
\\\\
\subsection{Semantic equivalence of UDFs}
Equivalence for mathematical functions is intuitively defined as $f: S \mapsto T, g: U \mapsto V, \forall x \in S: f(x) = g(x)$ with $S = U, T = V$. If the domain, ie. the function signature, matches and the results are equal for every input, the functions are considered to be equivalent. We have to extend this definition a little to bear the newly introduced aspects of real (database-)world procedures.

The signatures of a PostgreSQL-UDF does contain many different keywords reflecting properties of the function to give hints to the database-system how to UDF is callable or what kind of optimizations are applicable. Therefore, we require the translation not only to match the function signature (say: $gcd(int, int) : int$), but also the complete CREATE FUNCTION-block surrounding the actual function body. If a function is marked eg. as IMMUTABLE, the translation preserves this property. The only exception are UDFs that are marked PARALLEL SAFE, that is changed to PARALLEL RESTRICTED since the translation uses non-parallel safe operations like CTE-Scans (15.4. Parallel Safety).

In general, we cannot assume that UDFs are total, ie. that they terminate for all possible inputs from the input space. Assume a function that only terminates for positive inputs or may throw a division-by-zero error. This behaviour must be preserved by the translation, otherwise it would be not be clear if an error is actual a bug in the original function or introduced by the translation.

\subsection{Auxillary notations}
\begin{align*}
    T[a \mapsto \top] &:= T \cup \{a\}\\
    T[a \mapsto \bot] &:= T \setminus \{a\}\\
    T[a_1 \mapsto r_1, ..., a_n \mapsto r_n] &:= T[a_1 \mapsto r_1] \cdots[a_n \mapsto r_n]\\
\end{align*}
\\\\
For the CTE-store $C$ we define an ordered hash-map with the CTE-alias $a$ as key. The empty CTE-store is denoted as $\varnothing$. A new CTE, given by the CTE-body $t$, its predicate $p$ and the set of referenced CTEs on the same level $r$, is specified as $e=(t, p, r)$ alongside with its key $a$. It is appended to $C$ by the following operation: $C[a: e]$. Ordered subsets of $C$ can be retrieved by filtering for matching keys, ignoring keys not found: $C[\{a_1, ..., a_n, a_x\}] = \langle (a_1, t_1, p_1, r_1)_1, \dots, (a_n, t_n, p_n, r_n)_n\rangle$.
\\\\
The auxiliary function $\sigma_{\text{cols}}$ is used to pick columns from the store by name, eg. $\sigma_{a, t, p, r}(C)$ returns the entire store $\langle (a, t, p, r)_1, \dots, (a, t, p, r)_n \rangle$ and $\sigma_p(C) = \langle p_1, \dots, p_n \rangle$ all predicates in the store.

% Intuition how scenario analysis works, then formal inference rules are presented
% Begin with four rules to translate the core of each recurisve UDF
% Extending scope to whole queries
% Adding CTEs
% Post processing

% UDF is analyzed and a intermediate representation is created that is used as input for the query template. 
% Each scenario consists of a single path through the case-distinctions of the original query. A predicate is generated alongside to detect when this path is taken. Recursive and nonrecursive scenarios are distinguished.
% Scenarios are generated by recursively applying inference rules to the original function-body. The idea behind each rules is first illustrated before the formal definition is presented
% I will begin with four rules necessary to translate the heart of every recurisve UDF, the CASE-expression. Then I will extend the scope to cover arbitrary "function-alikes" from `+` to whole queries. I complete with rules to handle CTEs, which will introduce a couple of complexities that need special considerations.
% Before the scenarios can be used to fill in the query template, some postprocessing is needed. Callsites need to be enumerated and scenarios must be augmented with a list of contained scenarios. Furthermore, arguments must be extracted to individual queries.

This chapter gives detailed insights of how a given query is sliced into its scenarios and predicates by presenting inference rules. Before introducing the actual formal rules, I will first give an solid intuition of how the translation idea for each language construct works, before formalizing it.

I begin with presenting a set of four rules that are required to translate simple \CASE-expressions. The nonrecursive rules \RREC und \RBASE handle the case when the sql-fragment is directly a recursive call resp. does not contain any call at all. Analyzing \CASE-expressions is the core of the translation process as it is the original source of any scenario. Each \WHEN-\THEN~branch is processed step by step by the \RWHEN-rule and eventually the \ELSE-branch by the \RELSE-rule.

To translate arbitrary expressions and whole queries we need a couple of more rules. Functions may have a number of recursive operands that can be translated independently from each other to create a number of scenarios of the original function. The same schema can be applied to ~\SELECT-~ and \FROM-lists. Finally, the \WHERE-part is simple since it consists only of a single expression.

Finally, we allow the use of CTEs that come with a couple of complexities. Due to CTEs it is possible that a recursive sql-fragment does not contain a callsite directly but only the CTE. Furthermore, CTEs can reference other CTEs so it is necessary to track CTE-dependencies and maintain a list of recursive CTEs while taking shadowing into account.

Before the templates can be finally filled, the we need to extract callsite-arguments from the scenario and enumerate callsites to identify them later during evaluation.
\\
\\
By application of the inference rules we receive a set of nonrecursive scenarios $B$ and a set of recursive scenarios $R$. Each scenario consists of a predicate $p_i$ and the equivalent form of the original query $q_i$ under that predicate.

$$
\Big(
    \overbrace{\big\{
        \underbrace{
            (p_1, q_1)
        }_{\text{scenario 1}}
    \big\}}^{\text{basecase scenarios}}
    ,
    \overbrace{\big\{
        \underbrace{
            (p_2, q_2)
        }_{\text{scenario 2}},
        \underbrace{
            (p_3, q_3)
        }_{\text{scenario 3}}
    \big\}}^{\text{recursive scenarios}}
\Big)
$$

%There are two base-rules that require no more rule application and lead to an immidiate result: \RBASE and \RREC. The \RBASE-rule is applicable when a subtree $q$ contains no recursive calls or references to recursive table-expressions. We directly obtain the resulting tuple $(\{q\}, \emptyset)$. The other case is the \RREC-rule, which handles a subtree $q$ where the root node is the recursive call itself. To comply with the overall restrictions given under X.Y.Z, no argument may have a callsite. If this is given, the rule leads directly to $(\emptyset, \{q\})$. TODO: EXPLAN REF

%All other rules require a callsite somewhere within the query, unwrapping each layer of the query until the callsite is reached or no callsite exists in the subtree. The rules for handling \CASE-statements create for each possible outcome one pruned version while extending the given predicate by the predicate of the taken \WHEN-branch. In contrast to SELECT-statements and CASE-expressions, other parts of the query \textit{can} contain callsites in sibling subtrees. The idea here is to compute all possible outcomes of these subtrees independantly and then build the cartesian-product to receive all possible scenarios of the execution of the parent node. The \REXPR-rule implements purely this idea and the \RCTE and \RFROM-rule come as variations or extensions that take distinct particularities into account.

%The most complicated rule is for handling \WITH-statements. As in the \REXPR-rule, each execution-scenario for every CTE is computed and then the cartesion-product is build over all the scanarios. But two difficulties needs to be considered: First, each CTE can reference previous CTEs from within the same WITH-statement. Second, not every CTE may be referenced later on when the actually query (without the CTEs) is processed - eg. the referencing part may be pruned away after application of a \RWHEN-rule. This leads to to multiple identical versions of the original query that only differ in their predicates, namely by the case-distinctions from the unused CTE. This is semantically not a problem but can degrade performance, since callsites are enumerated based on the set of recursive and nonrecursive cases. Unfortunately, it is hardly possible to postpone this step to postprocessing since we would have to identify and remove the parts caused by the unused CTE from the predicate. Thus we hve two rules for handling CTEs: One for processing and removing each CTE one by one from the query and one for reconstructing the original \WITH-Statement, limited to that CTEs that are actually used by the translated query eventually.

%So, how does the CTE-Rules work in detail? Each CTE is processed on its own, one by one. The processed CTE is removed from the query and put into the variable-store and added alongside with its predicate to the temporary CTE-list. Depending on the processed CTE the recursive or nonrecursive store/list is choosen. Computation continues as long as CTEs are present. Finally, the complete query including CTEs is reconstructed. The actual query is translated with emptied temporary CTE-lists. Only CTEs that are referenced (directly or indirectly) are kept and their predicates are appended to the result predicate. To find out what CTEs are referenced, all free variables under the given environment need to be recursivly followed.

\section{Translating simple case distinctions}
% Goal is to translate a simple CASE-statement
% Start with primitive rules that do not recurse
% Within CASE-expressions the callsite can be located at two different places: WHEN and THEN
% CASE-expressions can be nested, again this can happen in the WHEN and in the THEN part.

For this section, we focus on the set of rules that are involved in every translation. Those rules are the axioms that will eventually add an expression either to $B$ or to $R$. Beside those basic rules, obviously, handling \CASE-distinctions are an integral part of every translation. With those few rules it is already possible to analyze very simple expressions, as we will see in an example.

\subsection{Callsites and basecases}
The inference rules are applied recursively to an initial query, removing each layer one by one. In the end, there are two basecases to that recursion. Either we arrive at a \textit{callsite}, ie. the invocation of the function itself, or the current subtree contains no callsite anymore. In the latter case, it is not necessary to descend any further, we can consider the entire subtree as basecase.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{minipage}[b]{.5\linewidth}
    \centering % BASE
$$\quad(\textsc{base})\inferrule{
   \neg \hasCallsite(T, e) \\
   \neg \text{isElse}(e)
}{
    T, \varnothing \vdash (p, e) \rightarrow (\{(p, e)\},\{\})
}$$
    \subcaption{}\label{rule:base}
    \end{minipage}\hfill
    \begin{minipage}[b]{.5\linewidth}
    \centering % REC
$$\quad(\textsc{rec})\inferrule{
   \forall i \in \{1, ..., n\} : \neg \hasCallsite(T, x_i)
}{
    T, C \vdash (p, fn(x_1, ..., x_n)) \rightarrow (\{\}, \{(p, fn(x_1, ..., x_n))\})
}$$
    \subcaption{Recursive scenarios}\label{rule:rec}
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Rule (a) assigns any sql-fragment to $B$ if it does not contain any callsites. (b) Does handle callsites by adding them to $R$. Note that the rule enforces the restriction that no callsites may have recursive arguments. For now, please ignore the environment $(T, C)$.}\label{rule:base_and_rec}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{rule:base_and_rec} you can see the axioms \RREC- and \RBASE. They handle the two cases and add either the callsite to the set of recursive cases $R$ or the nonrecursive subtree to $B$.



\subsection{Simple \CASE-expressions}

The other rules that are endeavoured in every nontrivial translation are those for handling \CASE-expressions. They are the original source of any scenario we will generate. As each branch contain a \WHEN-part which establishes a predicate and a \THEN-part that defines the result, there are two places were a callsite can occur and need to be handled appropriately. As \CASE-expressions can be nested, we will take a look at what happens when they are located in the \WHEN-part and in the \THEN-part.

\CASE-expressions in general are a handy way of writing nested \texttt{IF}s. Each \WHEN implies that all preceding \WHEN's have failed, ie. each \WHEN contains an implicit negation of preceding \WHEN's. Our goal is to make this complete, implicit predicate explicit so that it can be executed individually to tell during the callstack discovery phase (\autoref{}) which callsites are reached during each call.

\autoref{fig:simple_case} visualizes the program flow of a simple \CASE-expression with callsites located in the first \WHEN and in the \ELSE-branch. An arrow to the right means that the predicate is fulfilled, an arrow down denotes the negation. Predicates $p$ are surrounded by a single lined border while doubled bordered box marks a possible result $r$ of the \CASE-statement. An asteriks $\ast$ marks recursive subexpressions. The segmented rectangles at the right show the scenarios generated, an asteriks marks an recursive scenario. The second segment contains the predicate of the scenario, followed by the actual query.

\subsection{Recursive \WHEN's}
Recursive predicates cannot be solved and are therefore considered as part of the result (recursive) expression. Slicing stops before a recursive predicate.

Subtrees with no callsite are taken as one big basecase without further slicing.

\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{Nested Case in \THEN}
Predicates stack up linearily when nested inside \THEN.


Predicates must be evaluable directly for our translation template, ie. no callsite may be present in any predicate. Therefore, as soon as a predicate appears to be recursive, the recursive predicate is considered part of the recursive result and the evaluation of the \CASE-expression halts with the remaining \CASE-expression which forms an recursive case as a whole.

\section{Handling CTEs}
% Without CTEs hasCallsite just checks the subtree
The notion of \textit{containing a callsite} (or being \textit{recursive}) is simple when considering only S-F-W queries. If a sql-fragment $e$ contains a callsite, the subexpression is recursive: $\hasCallsite(e) = fn \sqsubset e$. From an implementation point of view, it is as simple as filtering the AST of $e$ for callsites.

(\autoref{fig:trimmed_ref}), (\autoref{fig:simple_indiref})

         T AS (SELECT * FROM S)
    SELECT * FROM T

    )

\end{minipage}
\caption{}
\label{lst:indirect_callsite_ref}\vspace{-5mm} 
\end{wrapfigure}

% CTEs introduce indirect callsites that make callsite detection more complicated
With CTEs we need to take into account two things. First, callsites can now be located outside the current subtree. Second, the scenario may contain unused recursive CTEs, fooling $\hasCallsite$ stated above to believe a given SQL-fragment is recursive, even if the recursive CTEs are never evaluated.

% Removing all CTEs, translating then and then reattaching only used CTEs fixes this.
We can work around this issues, if we remove the CTEs from the original query before translating the actual query. For each query-scenario only those CTEs are reattached afterwards, that are actually used (\autoref{tracking_recursive_ctes}). To detect indirect callsite references, we note recursive CTEs when detaching (\autoref{tracking_cte_dependencies}) and check against that list if we encounter unbound table-variables.

\subsection{Tracking recursive CTEs}\label{tracking_recursive_ctes}

% Recursive CTEs are gathered step by step 
CTEs are processed individually step by step before the actual query. If a CTE contains a callsite, its alias is added to the list of recursive CTEs in scope $T$. Otherwise, the alias is removed from that list to take shadowing into account as CTEs can be nested (\autoref{lst:indirect_callsite_ref}). As we continue with the following CTEs, any CTE that has no direct callsite but contains a reference to a CTE in $T$, is also added itself to $T$ as the evaluation of that CTE will eventually lead to a recursive call. This way, we can build up $T$ incrementally and do not need to track each reference recursively back to its declaration to find out whether its recursive. For an example see \autoref{fig:tracking_recursive_ctes}

Otherwise, the alias is removed to take into account shadowing.}
    \label{fig:tracking_recursive_ctes}
\end{figure}

% Referenced CTEs are detected via unbound variables
References to CTEs can be easily extracted from a sql-fragment by collecting unbound table-variables. Let us call the function that computes all free table-variables of a sql-fragment $e$ $\FV(e)$. It is implemented straight forward: Each CTE definition within a \WITH-block adds its alias to the list of bound table-variables. Every reference to a table-variable that is not contained in that list is considered free.


\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\textwidth}
    \begin{minted}{sql}
    WITH T AS (SELECT fn(n-1))
    SELECT *
    FROM (
      WITH T AS (SELECT 1)
      SELECT * FROM T
    ) T
    \end{minted}
    \caption{The outer, recursive CTE \texttt{T} is shadowed by an inner CTE.}
    \label{lst:indirect_callsite_ref}
\end{wrapfigure}

% Row-references vs. table-variables
Note that there can occur two different types of free variables inside a sql-fragment: \textit{Table-Variables} and \textit{Row-References}. Table-variables like \texttt{T} can exclusively be used in ~\FROM~ and reference an entire table. This table-variables are introduced either by the existence of a table in the current database or by an CTE. Row-references like \texttt{T.v} point to a single table-row of a table referenced by ~\FROM. Not the actual "use" of a table-variable via a row-reference causes the recursive call, but its bare existence in the FROM-clause since it is evaluated first. For this reason it is sufficient to track only \textit{table}-variables and ignore row-references entirely.

The function to judge whether a sql-fragment is recursive looks now as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \hasCallsite(T, e) =& fn(\dots) \sqsubset e \lor \FV(e) \cap T \neq \emptyset
\end{align*}
Either the callsite is directly contained in $e$, or it has a free table-variable that is also enlisted in $T$. Otherwise the snippet is not recursive.

%We process CTEs of a \WITH-block top down, before translating the actual \SELECT-query, resembling the way SQL evaluates them. If a CTE \texttt{T} references a CTE \texttt{S} that is recursive, \texttt{T} is also recursive. SQL evaluates CTEs in the order they are defined, so that preceding CTEs can be referenced by following CTEs (figure 4.4a FIXME?). Furthermore, CTEs can be nested so that we need to take care of shadowing out outer CTEs.

%Instead of tracing every reference through the entire query until the initial definition is found, I take an incremental approach: If a new table-variable is created, we check each free variable in its subtree against the environment of known recursive table-references within that scope. If there is a recursive table referenced or the subtree contains an immediate recursive call, the new table-reference is entailed the set of recursive table-references.

%Each CTE-scenario is augmented with its dependencies to previously defined CTEs. Each CTE is sliced into its different scenarios, then each scenario is analyzed, removed from the query and stored in the queue. When all CTEs are processed and the actual query is translated, only those CTEs are reattached to the query-scenario that are actually used. Indirect callsites can be detected by simply checking if there exists a free table-variable that is enlisted in $T$.

\subsection{Tracking CTE-dependencies}\label{tracking_cte_dependencies}
As we have seen, CTEs may use other CTEs so that we need to keep track of the CTE dependencies of a query. This happens similar to the creation of the set $T$ of recursive CTEs. For each CTE \texttt{C} we collect all CTE-references \texttt{$C_i$} and add them to the set of dependencies $D_c$. Because the used CTEs may have again dependencies, they are also added to $D_c$. Because of the linear ordering we can do this step by step. See \autoref{fig:cte_deps} for an illustration.

$$\refs(q) := \FV(q) \cup \left(\bigcup_{c \in \FV(q)} \refs(c)\right)$$

    \node[anchor=west] (Br) at (3, -1) {$\refs(b) = \FV(b) \cup \emptyset = \emptyset$};
    \node[anchor=west] (Cr) at (3, -2) {$\refs(c) = \FV(c) \cup (\refs(a) \cup \refs(b)) = \{\texttt{A}, \texttt{B}\}$};
    \node[anchor=west] (Dr) at (3, -3) {$\refs(d) = \FV(d) \cup (\refs(c)) = \{\texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{C}\}$};

    \caption{References are tracked incrementally by collecting free table-variables (ie. direct CTE references) along with the references of those free table-variables.}
    \label{fig:cte_deps}
\end{figure}

While shadowing was an issue when tracking recursive CTEs, it does not hit us here. The difference is that $T$ was passed down while $C$ is only nonempty at the current nesting-level. Any new CTE in a subexpression $e$ binds the previously free table-variable, preventing it from occurring in the CTE-dependencies. Thus, $\FV(e)$ already takes care of shadowing here.

\section{Postprocessing of the scenarios}
\subsection{Extraction of callsite-arguments}
We need to extract the arguments of the callsites within a recursive case, eg: 
\begin{minted}{sql}
SELECT T.a + T.b + T.c FROM (SELECT f(n-1, 2), 3, 4 + f(5, 6) FROM T WHERE p) AS T(a, b, c)
\end{minted}
into a set of callsite-arguments with its arguments $\{(\SELECT n-1, \SELECT 2), (\SELECT 5, \SELECT 6)\}$. As we require the callsite-arguments to be uncorrelated, we do not have to deal with references to \FROM but only to CTEs, wich simplifies things greatly.

Remove sourrinding query if callsite is within \SELECT, because the value of the callsite-arguments must be invariant to the tables references in \FROM.
$$\quad(\textsc{select})\inferrule{
    \exists i \in \{1, ..., n\}: \text{containsCallsite}(s_i) \\
    \forall i \in \{1, ..., n\}: \varnothing \vdash s_i \rightarrow P_i
}{
    \varnothing \vdash \SELECT s_1, ..., s_n \FROM f \WHERE w \rightarrow \\\\
    \{(\SELECT e_1, ..., \SELECT e_k) | (e_1, ..., e_k) \in \cup_{i \in \{1, ..., n\}} P_i \}
}$$

Remove outer query if callsite is within FROM, because sourrounding query is irrelevant for evaluation of subqueries in FROM.
$$\quad(\textsc{from})\inferrule{
    \forall i_j \in \{i_1, ...., i_m\} \subseteq \{1, ..., n\}: \text{containsCallsite}(f_{i_j})\\
    \forall i_j \in \{i_1, ...., i_m\}: \varnothing \vdash f_{i_j} \rightarrow P_{i_j}
}{
    \varnothing \vdash \SELECT s \FROM a_1 \AS f_1 \otimes ... \otimes a_n \AS f_n \WHERE w \rightarrow \cup_{i \in \{1, ..., n\}} P_i
}$$

Evaluate CTEs seperately, keeping previous CTEs that are referenced, in the case that there are callsites inside CTEs. Saving also every CTE to the CTE-store if they are references form the actual query.
$$\quad(\textsc{cte})\inferrule{
    \varnothing \vdash t_1 \rightarrow P \\
    C[a_1 : (t_1, FV^+(C, t_1))] \vdash \WITH a_2 \AS t_2, ..., a_n \AS t_n ~q \rightarrow P_w
}{
    C \vdash \WITH a_1 \AS t_1, ..., a_n \AS t_n ~q \rightarrow \\\\
    \{(\WITH [a_i \AS t_i]_{(a_i, t_i) \in C[FV^+(e_1)]} ~e_1, ..., \WITH [a_i \AS t_i]_{(a_i, t_i) \in C[FV^+(e_m)]} ~e_m) | (e_1, ..., e_m) \in P\} \cup P_w
}$$


$$\quad(\textsc{with})\inferrule{
    \varnothing \vdash q \rightarrow P
}{
    C \vdash \WITH q \rightarrow \\\\
    \{(\WITH [a_i \AS t_i]_{(a_i, t_i) \in C[FV^+(e)]} ~e_1, ..., \WITH [a_i \AS t_i]_{(a_i, t_i) \in C[FV^+(e_m)]} ~e_m) | (e_1, ..., e_m) \in P\}
}$$

Remove surrounding expression for every branch that contains a callsite, collecting results of all arguments.
$$\quad(\textsc{expr})\inferrule{
    \exists i \in \{1, ...., n\}: \text{containsCallsite}(e_i)\\
    \forall i \in \{1, ...., n\}: \varnothing \vdash e_i \rightarrow P_i
}{
    \varnothing \vdash \text{expr}(e_1, e_2, ..., e_n) \rightarrow \cup_{i \in \{1, ...., n\}} P_i
}$$

Remove recursive call and collect args.
$$\quad(\textsc{call})\inferrule{
}{
    \varnothing \vdash fn_{rec}(e_1, e_2, ..., e_n) \rightarrow \{ (e_1, e_2, ..., e_n) \}
}$$

If subbranch contains no callsite, stop and return empty set.
$$\quad(\textsc{nocall})\inferrule{
\neg \text{containsCallsite}(e)
}{  
    \varnothing \vdash e \rightarrow \{\}
}$$

Callsites within aggregate-functions are forbidden by the restriction that there must be a static number of callsites. Looping through a table, evaluating a recursive call per row is not allowed.



\chapter{Query templates}
% Evaluation of recursive functions
The translated functions follow all a common schema in general. First, the callstack-graph is created, top-down until the basecases are reached. The basecases are then evaluated with the according arguments discovered by the callgraph. Evaluation continues bottom-up as new recursive cases have results of their callsites available.

% Two phases: Callstack growth and callstack evaluation
This two phases, callstack discovery and callstack evaluation, are implemented by two CTEs, \texttt{callstack} and \texttt{evaluation}. The final query selects the desired final output from the evaluation-CTE. \autoref{fig:standard_template_structure} illustrates the very high level idea of the standard translation template.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \sqlcode{snippets/template_structure.sql}
    \caption{High-level structure of the standard query template (simplified).}
    \label{fig:standard_template_structure}
\end{figure}

% Special care needs to be taken to behave not only in terms of result values, but also in terms of termination.
Special care needs to be taken to behave like the original function in terms of termination. Call-loops in the original function lead to an infinite growing callstack, causing nontermination. By using memoization in the translation, this does not happen in our template, so we have to detect that case and manually init nontermination.

In this chapter I will provide a number of "macros" that fill the templates with values. I give these macros with respect to the running example of \texttt{fib}, so for a function with a single attribute. This avoids cluttering difficult spots with excessiv notation. To generalize to more attributes the following things need to be done:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Instead of a single column \texttt{in\_1} or \texttt{out\_1}, we need further columns \texttt{in\_2, ..., in\_n} and \texttt{out\_2, ..., out\_n}.
    \item Whenever we match tables by their arguments, eg. \texttt{(c.in\_1) = (e.out\_1)} it is clear that this needs to be altered analogous to \texttt{(c.in\_1, c.in\_2, ..., c.in\_n) = (e.out\_1, e.out\_2, ..., out\_n)}.
    \item The same applies whenever replacing UDF arguments: \texttt{q[x1/\$1]} needs to become \texttt{q[x1/\$1, x2/\$1, ..., xn/\$n]}.
\end{itemize}
For full examples with more than one argument see the appendix. 

\section{Callstack discovery}

The idea of the callstack-CTE is to utilize the generated predicates from the recursive scenarios to detect which callsites in the original query are reached with the arguments of the current invocation.
Starting with the original arguments of the UDF-invocation the applicable scenario is detected and the contained callsites are discovered. The arguments passed to the newly discovered callsites are evaluated independetly and used to recursively collect subsequent calls.

\subsection{Tabular callstack representation}

    \caption{Callstack-graph of \texttt{fib(4)} (a) and its tabular representation as generated by the \texttt{callstack}-CTE (b). Each edge represents a callsite.}\label{fig:fib_callstack}
\end{figure}

The callstack-CTE creates a direct encoding of the callstack graph (\autoref{fig:fib_callstack}). Each row depicts an edge between two nodes, including the label. Nodes of the callgraph correspond to recursive invocations, identified by their arguments, one column per argument. Beside arguments of the caller and callee, the id of the callsite is noted. Callsite ids are required during evaluation to check whether all callsites have an result available.

\subsection{Collecting callsite arguments}

Thanks to the data from the scenario analysis, the query to add the rows for new callsite can be generated by a simple macro (\autoref{marco:collect_call_maybe}). The predicate acts as guard to add only callsites of the appropriate evaluation scenario. Only if the predicate is fulfilled, any row is returned. The third row in \autoref{fig:fib_callstack_table} is eg. generated by \mintinline{postgresql}{<collect_call_maybe(d.out_1, p1, <callsite id: 2, arg_1: (SELECT $1 - 2)>)>}.

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering\small
    \begin{minted}{sql}
    <collect_call_maybe(in_arg_1, predicate, callsite)>
        := SELECT
             in_arg_1                    AS in_1, 
             callsite.id                 AS callsite_id,
             callsite.arg_1[in_arg_1/$1] AS out_1
           FROM predicate AS p(is_true)
           WHERE p.is_true
    \end{minted}
  \caption{Pseudocode to generate a single call to the callstack-table. $q[y/x]$ denots the operation of replacing y for x in q. For \texttt{in\_arg\_1} it is used in the beginning \$1 and later references to preceding arguments from the table.}
  \label{marco:collect_call_maybe}
\end{figure}

The macro from \autoref{marco:collect_call_maybe} creates only a query, returning one or none rows. To collect \textit{all} callsites, the query needs to test all callsites of all scenarios (\autoref{macro:collect_calls}). As all callsites within a scenario depend on the same predicate, the scenario-predicate can be pulled up into a CTE to avoid multiple evaluations.

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering\small
\begin{minted}{sql}
<collect_calls(in_arg_1, scenarios)> :=
    WITH p1 AS (scenarios[1].predicate)[in_arg_1/$1],
         p2 AS (scenarios[2].predicate)[in_arg_1/$1]
         
    -- Scenario 1
    (   -- Callsite 1
        <collect_call_maybe(in_arg_1, p2, scenarios[2].callsites[1])>   )
    
    UNION
    
    -- Scenario 2
    (   -- Callsite 2
        <collect_call_maybe(in_arg_1, p1, scenarios[1].callsites[1])>
      UNION
        -- Callsite 3
        <collect_call_maybe(in_arg_1, p1, scenarios[1].callsites[2])>   )
\end{minted}
  \caption{All callsites of all scenarios needs to be tested to cover the entire function.}
  \label{macro:collect_calls}
\end{figure}

With the query generated by \texttt{<collect\_calls(\$1, scenarios)>} all callsites of the initial UDF invocation are obtained. Subsequent levels of the callstack can be collected recursively by using the \texttt{out\_1}-column from the previous iteration instead of \texttt{\$1}. For each callsite from the previous iteration, the according evaluation scenario needs to be detected to collect new callsites. This for-each behaviour is implemented by \texttt{LATERAL} in the marco for \texttt{callstack}.

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
\begin{minted}{postgresql}
<callstack(rec_scenarios)> :=
  (
    (SELECT NULL, 0, $1) -- add original call
      UNION ALL
    <collect_calls($1, rec_scenarios)> 

  ) UNION (
    SELECT
      new_calls.*
    FROM
      callstack AS c, LATERAL (
        <collect_calls(c.out_1, rec_scenarios)>
      ) AS new_calls
  )
\end{minted}
  \caption{}
  \label{}

Callstack growth ends as soon as no recursive scenario is applicable for any newly discovered callsites, ie. all callsites lead to basecases. In this case, the new iteration contains no rows, making \texttt{WITH RECURSIVE} stop.

\section{Callstack evaluation}
% Evaluation starts bottom up at the leaves of the callstack
Evaluation starts bottom up from the leafs of the callgraph. Scenarios are evaluated by replacing their original arguments with references to the arguments from the callgraph (\autoref{macro:single_basecase}). Scenarios may depend on other scenarios that need to be evaluated first. If all dependencies of a scenario are evaluated, the scenario can be evaluated itself. Nonrecursive scenarios have no dependencies by definition and can be evaluated therefore straight ahead. From this initial rows evaluation continues. Finally, the desired result can be selected.

\subsection{Evaluating nonrecursive scenarios}
Arguments for the evaluation of nonrecursive scenarios can be found in the leafs of the callgraph.
Evaluation of a single scenario is rather simple. UDF-arguments like \texttt{\$1} are replaced by references to arguments from the callgraph. The predicate from the generated scenario is evaluated in the \texttt{WHERE}-clause and prevents evaluation of wrong scenarios. \autoref{macro:single_basecase} shows a macro for evaluating a single scenario. Each scenario corresponds to a single query returning one or no rows. To collect all scenarios the union of this queries is built.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{minted}{postgresql}
<evaluate nonrecursive scenario(scenario, callgraph)>
 := SELECT c.out_1                    AS in_1, 
           scenario.query[c.out_1/$1] AS result
    FROM callgraph c
    WHERE scenario.predicate[c.out_1/$1]
    \end{minted}
    \caption{Macro for nonrecursive scenario evaluation.}
    \label{macro:single_basecase}
\end{figure}

For efficiency, nodes of recursive scenarios are filtered from the callgraph (resulting in CTE \texttt{calls\_to\_basecase}) as they cannot belong to basecases. If a callsite with argument \texttt{out\_1} can be found as input argument \texttt{in\_1} in the callgraph, then \texttt{out\_1} belongs to a recursive scenario. Graphically speaking, the query selects nodes of the callgraph with no outgoing edges, namely leafs, which represents callsites that leads to basecases.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{minted}{postgresql}
<basecases(scenarios)> := 
   WITH calls_to_basecase(out_1) AS (
       SELECT DISTINCT out_1 
       FROM callgraph AS c
       WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT NULL FROM callgraph AS c2
                         WHERE c2.in_1 IS NOT DISTINCT FROM c.out_1)
   )
   <evaluate scenario(scenario[1], calls_to_basecases)>
     UNION ALL 
   <evaluate scenario(scenario[2], calls_to_basecases)>
    \end{minted}
    \caption{\texttt{basecase}-CTE.}
    \label{macro:basecases}
\end{figure}

The awkward \texttt{WHERE}-clause stirs from two issues. First, \texttt{IS NOT DISTINCT FROM} is the SQL-way of writing a simple \textit{=} while considering \mintinline{postgresql}{NULL=NULL} as true. This is required since \texttt{NULL} can be an argument of a callsite and needs to be matched with its result-row - tri-state logic hinders that. The \texttt{NOT EXISTS} comes from the fact that the simpler \texttt{NOT IN} is executed for every row as a subquery while \texttt{NOT EXISTS} is executed as a much more efficient antijoin. If disregarding this two issues, the \texttt{WHERE}-clause could be written easier to understand as \mintinline{postgresql}{c.out_1 NOT IN (SELECT c2.in_1 FROM callgraph c2)}.


\subsection{Recursive scenario evaluation}
The evaluation of recursive scenarios follows the schema of the evaluation of nonrecursive scenarios, but is a bit more involved. Callsite-results must be collected per scenario to decide if the scenario is evaluable yet. Only if all callsites of a scneario are evaluated, the scenario can be evaluated itself.

This operation resembles relational divsion $\texttt{S} \div \texttt{R}$: When dividing \texttt{S} by \texttt{R}, table \texttt{S} is grouped by the attributes that are not involved as join-attributes with \texttt{R}. The grouped columns from \textit{S} are returned, if every row in the group have found a join-partner from \texttt{S}. By dividing \texttt{callgraph} by \texttt{evaluation} (projecting away \texttt{callgraph.call\_site\_id}), we obtain only those input arguments that are evaluable, ie. have all required callsite-results available.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\textwidth}
  \sqlcode{snippets/relational_division.sql}
  \caption{Selecting available callsite-results per scenario using relational division with \texttt{array\_agg}. Does not play well with array-arguments.}
  \label{relational_division}
\end{wrapfigure}

The difficulty is to collect those callsite-results. The intuitive approach is to add an \texttt{array\_agg(e.result)} to the relational division (\autoref{relational_division}) that collects the results per scenario. This works well as long as we do not allow arrays as arguments: \texttt{array\_agg} require all input arrays to have the same dimensionality.

The solution is to avoid array aggregation and to "pivot" the groups instead: each callsite-result gets its own column. Pivoting is implemented by using Window-Functions and Partitions together with \texttt{nth\_value} instead of \texttt{GROUP BY} and \texttt{array\_agg}. This way, we circumvent any constraints regarding arrays and avoid expensive aggregation.

\vspace{5mm}

With this problem solved, evaluating a recursive scenario boiles down to replacing UDF-arguments and callsites with \texttt{callgraph}- resp. \texttt{evaluation}-references, similar to the evaluation of nonrecursive scenarios (\autoref{macro:single_basecase}). \autoref{macro:recursive_scenario_evaluation} gives a macro to evaluate a scenario utilizing the pivoting approach from above.

\end{figure}

The self-reference in recursive CTEs contains only the rows from the previous iteration, which is a problem when evaluating. Take the evaluation of \texttt{fib} for example (see \autoref{fig:fib_callstack_graph}): Each recursive scenario depends on the results from the last (\texttt{fib(n-1)}) and the penultimate iteration (\texttt{fib(n-2)}). Standard recursive CTE-semantics allows only access to \texttt{fib(n-1)}.

To work around this restriction, the working table is added to the actual result-rows in each iteration. If we choose this approach, the working-table will be never empty, but an empty working-table is the stopping criterion for evaluation of the CTE. Therefore we need to manually take care of returning an empty table when evaluation should stop. To achieve this, the new rows are computed seperately in a CTE and guard also addition of the previous results. \autoref{macro:evaluation_cte}, that shows the final \texttt{evaluation}-CTE, implements this approach.

\subsection{Result collection and termination}

The previous section introduced the components required to start and continue evaluation of recursive scenarios. The final task is to select the result or to trigger an infinite loop if a setting is detected where the original UDF does not terminate, but the translation has.

There are two ways how a recursive function may not terminate: Infinite recursion and looping calls. Infinite recursion leads always to new calls, never reaching a basecase, the callgraph is infinite. Each new call results in a new, different row that is added to the callgraph-table (\autoref{fig:infinite_callstack}). In this case, the translation does not terminate correctly, as the original.

    \caption{The function misses its basecase if called with an odd number like 3 and does not terminate. Every call leads to a new, different recursive call as call-arguments grow towards infinity.}\label{fig:infinite_callstack}
\end{figure}

The other case is looping calls. Since we utilize memoization, redundant calls lead only to a single row in the callgraph-table and not to multiple identical rows. Thus, the callgraph-table is finite while the original callgraph is not. Therefore, our implementation would terminate while the original does not. To maintain the original UDf behaviour we need to detect this case and trigger an infinite loop manually.

\end{figure}

How is this situation detectable? If at least one path in the callgraph contains a loop, this path have no basecase where evaluation could start and thus evaluation will stop eventually without having evaluated the root-node. There is no row in the \textit{evaluation}-CTE containing a result for the original UDF-arguments. Instead of returning an empty table, an infinite loop is triggered (\autoref{fig:some_loop}).

\chapter{Optimizations}

If certain assumptions about the function can be made, the translation templates can be simplified which speeds up execution. Some requirements about the argument types can be lifted with workarounds. The properties required to choose the best template are detected after scenario analysis.

Functions where each scenario has only a single callsite are called single recursive. In this case, callsite ids  are just a functional dependency of the scenario and can be removed therefore from the template.

A special form of single recursive functions are tail recursive functions. They do not have any evaluation context around any callsite so that the result can be immediately returned from the basecase and no evaluation phase is required.

Arguments that are never modified in the query and are just passed from call to call, eg. as a configuration parameter, can be excluded from the callstack table.

Finally, the limitation to require hashability on input arguments of the UDF can be lifted if we implement measures to work around this issues. This lead to a greater applicability but is not desireable in the general case where this costly workaround is not necessary.

Is distinct from is soo much slower compared to simple "=" => only do this, null is a valid input




\section{Single Recursion}
Callsite IDs are used to detect whether all subcalls of a recursive scenario have returned a result already.

If a function has in every scenario only a single subcall, callsite ids are an functional dependency of the scenarios and can therefore be removed.

\subsection{Detection}
\subsection{Template optimization}
Simple: only one callsite per 
Only one callsite => no need to wait for all callsites of a recursive call
no need to collect all callsites of a given recursive call
union all -> union...wieso?






\section{Tail Recursion}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
  \vspace{-20pt}
    \sqlcode{snippets/fib_tr.sql}
  \caption{Tail recursive formulation of \texttt{fib}}
  \label{lst:fib_tr}
\end{wrapfigure}

Special type of single recursion where no computation happens around any callsite.

Tail recursive function do not have a context around any callsite that would change the result returned by the basecase.

Instead of passing down the result from the basecase all the way down to the initial call, the result can be returned immediatly

[Template changes]

\subsection{Detection}
If the result of a recursive call is not used for further computations, ie. the computation context can be disposed, the call is a tail call. If all recursive calls are tail calls, the function is tail recursive. We can utilize this property to skip the evaluation phase which computes the results of all expressions containing a recursive call. In the case of tail recursion the recursive expression equals the call itself, thus no evaluation is required. Usually, the evaluation-phase computes the result of a call with given input parameters by waiting for the results of the callsites and then compute the result of this function call by evaluating the recursive expression with the calls replaced by its results.

A tail recursive function do not need this evaluation phase, because there is no context that need to be evaluated. The context in question is the very call itself. Therefore it is possible to skip the evaluation phase and return directly the result of the last call.

We detect tail recursive calls by analyzing the structure of the recursive cases returned by the static analysis. The only possible strucutre of a tail recursive call is the following
\begin{minted}{SQL}
SELECT (SELECT (SELECT f(..)))
\end{minted}
A complete Example:
\sqlcode{snippets/udf_gcd.sql}

Any computations like \texttt{1+(SELECT f(n))} would create a context around the call that need to be evaluated. The same for \FROM, even if the callsite-arguments contain no table-references, we are required to loop through the rows and create the output table.

If a function is a tail call but its argument references a CTE and therefore the query is prefixed by an \WITH-block, it is still tail recursive, because the reference to any CTE is within the callsite arguments that are removed alltogether with the call during evaluation. So, during evaluation time, the CTEs are not used and thus could be removed, and the expression is tail recursive.

\section{Constant parameter removal}

Some parameters are invariant during execution 

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
  \vspace{-20pt}
    \sqlcode{snippets/sieve.sql}
  \caption{Single recursive formulation of \texttt{fib}}
  \label{lst:fib_tr}
\end{wrapfigure}

Those parameters are identical in every row of the callstack-table and consume memory and CPU cycles when joining the callstack-table with evaluation results by their arguments.
Removing them from the callgraph-table saves memory and increases join-performance as a useless join-predicate can be omitted.
